    <h4><a href="#">Questions and Answers Forum</a></h4>
    <p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="#">questions and answers forum</a></span>Â is where you should ask any questions you have about this course. Since this is an 8-week course and things will be moving quickly, don't wait to ask questions! I will be checking in on the forums <strong>each day between 3pm and 4pm</strong>. Also, to encourage you to help each other out, extra credit will be given if you correctly answer another student's questions.</p>
    <p>Note: Please don't include personal information in any public forum posts. If you have questions that include things like your HSUID or grades, please do email me directly.</p>
